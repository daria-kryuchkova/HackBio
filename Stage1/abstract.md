**Single-Cell Genomics: A Stepping Stone for Future Immunology Discoveries**

The immune system, one of the most dynamic and plastic systems in the human body, creates a complex network that connects nearly every tissue. Characterizing the unique interactions of immune cells is crucial to enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. Since the 19th century, studies pioneered by Ilya Mechnikov have categorized immune cells into distinct types based on their morphology and cellular functions. Technological advancements have accelerated immunological identification studies. However, the belief that a small number of molecular determinants is sufficient to describe the diversity of immune cells has been disproven, as immune cell identity largely depends on their tissue and environmental context. Single-cell sequencing has been ideal because it can characterize the various cell types and states involved in immune cell functions. Crucially, single-cell approaches now integrate with flow cytometry, CyTOF, imaging, and spatial or lineage-tracing methods. These multimodal strategies reconnect transcriptional profiles with protein expression, spatial location, and clonal history, overcoming limitations of dissociated single-cell RNA-seq. Together, these advances reveal the full diversity, organization, and functional states of the immune system across health and disease. There are key challenges limiting the full potential of single-cell genomics in immunology. These include analytical complexity occasioned by large datasets that encompass thousands of cells having diverse transcriptional profiles, and other computational hassles such as accurate classification of cell types, differentiating subtle functional states, and filtering technical noise. Multimodal tools such as lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, and CRISPR-based perturbation assays are emerging, promising to restore contextual understanding. In conclusion, single-cell genomics is a key to decoding immune diversity and therapeutic innovation.
