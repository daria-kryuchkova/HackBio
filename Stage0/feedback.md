Grade: 9.0

**Suggested Improvements**: To improve the scientific content, include specific case studies or examples where single-cell RNA sequencing has provided groundbreaking insights in cancer research. Code improvements can include adding comments for better clarity, using docstrings in methods to explain their functionality, and implementing exception handling to manage potential errors.

**What we were expecting**: expected to list, dict

**Scientific Flaws**: The article effectively covers the progression and implications of single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer research. It discusses the current state-of-the-art technology, yet it fails to address some critical issues such as data interpretation biases due to noise and the requirement for advanced skills in data analysis. It would also benefit from highlighting specific examples where scRNA-seq has significantly impacted therapeutic strategies.

**Code Quality**: The code demonstrates a good use of object-oriented programming by encapsulating functionalities within a class. The use of pandas is appropriate for handling tabular data, and the code is modular, making it easy to extend. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section and would benefit from exception handling. There is also no testing to ensure that the functions behave as expected.
